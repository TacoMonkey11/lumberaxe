A fabric mod which adds lumberaxes to the game. Lumberaxes act like vein miner but just for logs.

This mod adds 4 tiers of lumberaxes, iron through netherite.

All lumberaxes follow the same crafting pattern, except for netherite, which uses the smithing table.

**Be careful when using this axe for general use, as you may end up destroying your base!**

**To only mine one block, crouch while mining.**
